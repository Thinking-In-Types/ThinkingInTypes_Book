## Misunderstanding Class Attributes

A number of type tools hack the class attribute syntax; the most obvious is dataclasses but there are others.
It's important to understand that this is special behavior created by the tool, and that ordinary classes do not behave this way.
Read the [Class Attributes] appendix for deeper understanding.

## Using Dataclasses Effectively

Dataclasses simplify class definitions by automatically generating methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`:

```python
# example_1.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Product:
    name: str
    price: float
    in_stock: bool = True

product = Product("Laptop", 999.99)
print(product)  # Product(name='Laptop', price=999.99, in_stock=True)
```

Dataclasses reduce boilerplate, ensuring concise and readable class definitions.

### Advanced Dataclass Features

Dataclasses support default factories, immutability, and more:

```python
# example_2.py
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Order:
    order_id: int
    items: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)

order = Order(order_id=123)
# order.order_id = 456  # Error: dataclass is frozen (immutable)
```
