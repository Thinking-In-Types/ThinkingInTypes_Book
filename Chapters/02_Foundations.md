# Foundations

Assumptions I make about your Python & programming knowledge.

## Your Python Knowlege

- You have intermediate-level understanding of the language, including a reasonable grasp of classes
- You understand core language features and know how to look up and learn features you haven't seen
- I will explain things I think are outside the core

## This book uses

- Version control (github)
- Automated Build (uv)
- Testing (pytest)
- Build up from small testable pieces
- Project organization (src directory)
- Black for consistent formatting
- Listings 47 Characters wide: readable on a phone
