## Using Dataclasses Effectively

Dataclasses simplify class definitions by automatically generating methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`:

```python
# example_1.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Product:
    name: str
    price: float
    in_stock: bool = True

product = Product("Laptop", 999.99)
print(product)  # Product(name='Laptop', price=999.99, in_stock=True)
```

Dataclasses reduce boilerplate, ensuring concise and readable class definitions.

### Advanced Dataclass Features

Dataclasses support default factories, immutability, and more:

```python
# example_2.py
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Order:
    order_id: int
    items: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)

order = Order(order_id=123)
# order.order_id = 456  # Error: dataclass is frozen (immutable)
```
